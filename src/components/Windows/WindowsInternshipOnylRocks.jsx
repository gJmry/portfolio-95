                    During my second and third years of my Bachelor's in Computer Science (BUT), I completed both a
                    two-month internship and a one-year apprenticeship at
                    <strong> Onyl Rocks</strong>, a company specializing in <em>cybersecurity</em>,
                    <em> web development</em>, and <em>IT infrastructure</em>.

                            My first project was with the platform <strong>MonJeuDeSociete.fr</strong>. I developed a custom web-based tool
                            that allows users to create interactive digital murals, inspired by projects like the ‚ÄúClimate Fresk‚Äù.
                            This tool was designed to be educational and collaborative.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I worked on both the frontend and backend using <strong>Symfony (PHP)</strong>, integrating with an existing codebase.
                            I also improved several features for better UX and helped debug existing components to make the platform more stable and user-friendly.

                            During my apprenticeship, I worked on a second project named <strong>Vigidomaine</strong>, a platform designed to monitor domain names
                            for security issues such as <em>typosquatting</em>, <em>SSL certificate problems</em>, and <em>domain expiration</em>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I contributed to features like automated domain scanning, report generation, and the implementation of the <strong>VigiScore</strong>,
                            a metric that evaluates how secure and compliant a domain is with cybersecurity standards.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I collaborated closely with my project manager to define tasks, clarify technical requirements, and present feedback on ongoing work‚Äî
                            all within an agile development environment.

    );
