It was a two-person project, and for a first real dive into C, it actually went pretty well! At first, figuring out memory management and handling user input felt a bit overwhelming, but as we kept going, things started to click. I had a lot of fun experimenting, breaking things, and then fixing them. Looking back, it was a great learning experience, and Iâ€™m really glad I got to explore C in such a hands-on way!",

It was my first time working with a web frameworkâ€”and also when I discovered Svelte, which quickly became my favorite! The project was pretty challenging, especially handling WebSockets and all the connections (not exactly second-year basics ðŸ˜…). But in the end, we were really proud of it, and honestly, Iâ€™m still a bit sad we didnâ€™t keep it going!",

It was a really fun project because it made understanding the basics of back-end and front-end feel super intuitive. Setting up routes and integrating them with Twig was honestly pretty cool! We had a lot of freedom in how we approached the project, which let us push it way further than expectedâ€”something that really impressed our teacher. Overall, it was a great experience, and we had a blast working on it! Also, the name of the application was Maki Malin, which explains the Sushi logo.",

There werenâ€™t many features to implementâ€”mainly just redirectionsâ€”but for a first-year project, it was still a challenge! Honestly, it was a really cool experience, and I had a lot of fun working on it.",
